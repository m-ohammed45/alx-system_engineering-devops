A server is a computer or system that provides resources or services to other computers or devices on a network. It can store and manage data, host websites, run applications, and more.

The domain name serves as the unique address of a website on the internet, allowing users to easily access the site by typing in the domain name in their browser.

In the case of www.foobar.com, the DNS record for www is typically a CNAME (Canonical Name) record, which points to the main domain name (foobar.com).

The web server's role is to handle incoming requests from user browsers, retrieve and serve web pages, images, CSS, and other resources to users.

An application server processes user requests, executes application logic, and interacts with databases or other external services to retrieve or store data.

The database server is responsible for storing, managing, and retrieving data for the website or application. It ensures data integrity and provides efficient data access.

The server communicates with the user's computer requesting the website using the HTTP protocol, which allows for the transfer of web pages and resources over the internet.

Issues with this infrastructure include:
- Single Point of Failure (SPOF): If a critical component like a load balancer fails, it can disrupt the entire system.
- Downtime during maintenance: Deploying new code or performing maintenance that requires restarting the web server can lead to temporary service interruptions.
- Inability to scale with high traffic: If the infrastructure cannot handle a sudden increase in incoming traffic, it may result in performance issues or downtime for users.
